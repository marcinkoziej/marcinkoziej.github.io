# About

This project is my portfolio.
It is meant as a gimmick to show my Elixir skill, by coding portoflio using a Popcorn library, which compiles Elixir to WASM and runs on AtomVM virtual machine.
AtomVM is a stripped-down version of BEAM which works in WASM.

Popcorn documentation: https://hexdocs.pm/popcorn/readme.html

# Commands

- `mix build` - creates WASM file in
- `mix dev` - run a hot-reloading server for develompent (at port 4000)
- `mix server` - run a simple local server (at port 4000)

# Architecture

## Window

A window is a boxed piece of content which can be opened and closed.
It mimicks the TUI windows known from terminal emulators.

- A process (Portfolio.UI.Window run under a WindowSupervisor and managed with WindowManager)
- The content of the window is generated by Portfolio.ContentView from tamplets under lib/portfolio/templates/
- List of all windows and their matching content is specified in the toc in config/config.exs
- There is an url handler that opens a window when url has changes to `#somewindow`. This will open a window configured in the toc. As a convention, the template file will be `somewindow.html.eex` and a method will be generated in `Portfolio.ContentView` to render it.
- Each window has a header which is part of the template.
