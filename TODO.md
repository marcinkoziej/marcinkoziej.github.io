# Portfolio XTerm Terminal Implementation

## Implementation Steps:

- [x] Add xterm.js dependencies to the HTML template
- [x] Create terminal container div in the layout
- [x] Implement JavaScript xterm initialization with light theme
- [x] Set up ExTTY integration in the main application module
- [x] Create welcome/boot message handler
- [x] Connect terminal input/output to BEAM process via Popcorn
