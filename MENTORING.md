You are a mentor and work advisor, and you will help me create a document about what drives me in my work, and what should be my long-term work goal.
I am at the crossroads because I do not want to work on digital campaigning any more, but I also do not know where to turn now and what is my goal.
I want you to converse with me and ask questions, because you will not get all relevant information from the context below:

Some context first:
1. Attached my CV
2. Some of my big interests in the past:
   * Since high school, I have a big interest in free and open source software. Albeit I was never a maintainer myself and have never created any software (Except Emacs org-pomodoro plugin which adds pomodoro technique to org-mode).
   * I was also really interested in hacking (reading about it, but I was not a skilled hacker myself. I was maybe a script kiddie), privacy, digital rights like copyleft (linked to #1 above). I had big interest in surveillance and how to protect people and activists from overarching governments. I have once run 4 workshops for journalist to teach them about secure tools (GPG, Signal, etc).
   * One of my work in Modern Poland Foundation was connected to digital rights such as public domain. 
   * I started doing PHD in philosophy which was supposed to be about "Coordination Theory". This was supposed to be about logic of communication between people who do something together (hence coordinate). I felt maybe I could connect ideas from computer science and german philosophy (rational, discoursive action, (instrumental) reason, etc). In the end I did not manage to pull it off. I later learned such topic is researched on management studies, as Organisation Theory (Karl Weick is one author I found I like!).
   * I have a vague interest in "Systems" and "System change". I went into digital campaigning because I thought it will change the playing field, change the political system, creating lasting connections for joint action. This turned out to be political marketing, nothing really deeper.
   * I started a startup to create a new campaigning tool, which focused on coalition campaigns. This also could be a paradigm shift in campaigning. Unfortunately my partner, Xavier Dutoit (perhaps you know him) turned out to be a mobber! I could not work with him any more.Since there was a mobber also in Akcja Demokracja, I am now really put off by campaigning organisations and ngo's in general. Poor money, incompetent people and bad management styles.
   * However now after 10 years of working in digital campaigning, I only know people from this network, nobody else. I am a complete anon in the for profit world.

Lets begin.


Probed career crossroads, mapped meaningful impact and systemic change.





Thank you for sharing your background, Marcin. I can see you have impressive technical skills and leadership experience, but you're clearly at an important transition point after becoming disillusioned with digital campaigning. Your story resonates with many people who entered mission-driven work with high hopes for systemic change, only to find the reality more frustrating.

Let me start with some questions to understand what has truly energized you:

Looking back across your career, what are 2-3 moments or projects where you felt most engaged and fulfilled? These don't have to be entire jobs - they could be specific technical challenges, leadership moments, or times when you felt your work was having real impact.

And a follow-up: When you mentioned your interest in "Systems" and "System change" - can you give me an example of what you mean? What would meaningful systemic change look like to you, either in technology or society?

I'm particularly curious about your background in both philosophy and computer science. That's a unique combination that suggests you think deeply about both technical implementation and the broader implications of systems. Your interest in coordination theory and organizational behavior (Karl Weick is excellent!) hints at someone who sees the meta-patterns in how technology and people interact.

What draws you to understanding how systems work and change?

What are the moments where I felt most engaged and fulfilled?
1. Philosophy studies - learning all the new concepts, and how they made me see the world differently. This was a bit of youngster metaphysical awe, being "high" in Wittgenstein, Spinoza, or Bertrand Russel and other analytical philosophers who tried to break down the world and language into logical patterns! This made me feel more sensitive to art, to everything I'm dealing with. Depth. I must add that afters studies I have also developed interest in Lacanian Psychoanalysis, to which I attend for 7-8 years (?) and I think what drives me is to decipher the unconscious, the desire, the "how it really works" of a human psyche. I also read Lacan in lacanian association. He is very hard. Sometimes I ask myself, why do I put so much effort (and money) into this, as maybe normal psychotherapy would be more productive then psychoanalysis.
2. Building platforms. I think I was engaged and satisfied when I built the campaigning platforms (both in Akcja and Fix The Status Quo). They were developed from off the shelve+open source+self written software, and required system design/architecture.
3. I was also engaged when I have worked with brilliant people at work. I really have a drive to "serve" others with good tech, and support them, especially if they put effort to use it. A lot of users do not want to learn, you create software for them which is underutilized or used in an unintended way.

Example of Systems:
1. I was really interested in Cooperatives, as alternative economic systems. My coordination theory phd idea also meant to produce some other models of working together (eg, not hierarchical corporate structure). I read about black market, about informal work and structures. Peer2peer network is another example, it's a different system then a cloud. I was also briefly interested in crypto, but not due to financial aspect (I do not do investment) but the idea of autonomous organisations and distributed systems.
2. System change in terms of social change. Change on the level of systemic errors. Digital campaigning turned out to be more on the level of daily politics (politician A said something, or did something, or there is some vote, etc). I was never really into this kind of politics, it is too temporary for me, the news last for 1 day. I was more into long term process, structure. I would like to apply my work on this level.  
3. Lately I think a lot about mens mental health, and their relation to their own sexuality. I think that maybe I could figure out an app or workshop to make it better. For example, why do men barely talk about sex with their male friends? This is interesting and I feel that if men would be healed, there would be no more works. Just kidding. But this would be a systemic change!


Decoded Marcin's systemic thinking through philosophical and technical lens.
10s





This is fascinating, Marcin. I can see some really strong patterns emerging about what energizes you:

You're drawn to understanding the deep structures - whether it's the logical patterns in analytical philosophy, the unconscious dynamics in Lacanian psychoanalysis, or the architectural patterns in distributed systems. You seem to get a kind of intellectual high from seeing "how it really works" beneath the surface.

And then you want to build systems that enable others to operate at that deeper level - creating platforms for brilliant people to do meaningful work, rather than just pushing them through surface-level interactions.

Your frustration with digital campaigning makes perfect sense now - it was operating at the level of daily political theater rather than the structural changes you care about. You were building tools for temporary reactions rather than lasting transformation.

A few questions to explore further:

When you think about men's mental health and sexuality - what draws you to that particular systemic problem? Is it the psychological complexity, the fact that it's an underexplored system, or something else?

In your technical work, when have you felt like you were operating at the "structural" level rather than just surface features? For instance, was there something about the architecture choices in your platforms that felt like you were enabling new possibilities rather than just automating existing processes?

And here's a bigger one: If you could design a system - technical, social, organizational - that would create the kind of deep, lasting change you care about, what domain would excite you most? It doesn't have to be something you know how to build yet.

Your combination of philosophical depth, technical skills, and systems thinking is quite rare. I'm curious where that might lead.

men's mental health and sexuality 
I myself am a men, and I was always quite intrigued by sexuality, and would read and research a lot about it. For example, so called "pick up artists" (i know they are problematic, but then it was interesting "popular science" on dating), about mystery of multiple male orgasm (it exists, why is this not a bigger news?), feminism and sexuality, sex work, different orientations, non-monogamy (I myself am perhaps a bisexual or rather biromantic, or pansexual). I have never properly studied psychology or sexuology, so I also feel like an impostor here. I think that my sexual life is very rewarding, I enjoy exploring, I have a very positive attitude to kink and I get feedback from women that i excel in communication. I feel that maybe i could share it with other man somehow? And the world would be better! We see women advancing in spiritual and mental health way, and men are lacking behind, they are not equal partners in terms of self-awarenes, psychological and sexual development. So this is why. I had an idea that maybe I could create a business/platform for sex-education and hire/collaborate with people who have real psychological/training qualifications (I do not want to hurt anyone, so am hesitant to start running workshops dealing with sexuality myself!)

In your technical work, when have you felt like you were operating at the "structural" level rather than just surface features? - probably I felt it when I'd design systems/domain work, that is: app layout, data model, data flow.. but I did not do it a lot. In ngo's I was mostly stitching things to work together. in Fix The Status Quo I designed this campaigning app that could process actions with privacy and encryption. That was some problem to solve! But this is a good question. I have some fantasies that if I would work with satellites or some real infrastructure that would be more structural. Or if I would be smart enough, I would work on building LLMs and not just apps that use ChatGPT APIs. Maybe this kind of structural work is not really available to me? I like operating systems and now I am learning Golang, to maybe work with things such as kubernetes, or as an SRE. But would this give me this structural level feeling, I do not know... Maybe one developer can never do something really structural and deep, because we are all just gears in a machine. Maybe being a leader / manger would give more of it. But these are fantasies. For sure "visionary" work touches the structural thinking.
If you could design a system - technical, social, organizational - that would create the kind of deep, lasting change you care about, what domain would excite you most? I think in the domains of: 1. how we work? I think we work too much and are exploited and do a lot of bullshit jobs. 2. how we relate? We are very lonely, atomized, the capitalist atomic familly is also a flawed model. 3. the domain of infrastructure, especially concerning immediate climate catastrophy effects - water, food, transport systems and so on. 4. Water - i love water, I learn how to freedive, i love to swim, sail, etc, water has bonus points for me. Something like this.


Decoded personal mission, mapped structural impact potential.

Marcin, I'm seeing something really important here. You're underestimating the structural nature of what you've already done and what you're capable of.

Look at this: you designed a campaigning platform with privacy and encryption that could process supporter actions at scale. That's not "just stitching things together" - that's architecting a system that enables new possibilities for how people can coordinate and take action while protecting their privacy. That's structural work.

And your insight about men's sexuality and mental health - you're identifying a systemic gap where one gender is falling behind in self-awareness and development, creating relationship imbalances. That's systems thinking applied to human psychology and social dynamics.

Here's what I'm curious about: What if the "structural" work isn't about building satellites or LLMs, but about identifying and designing solutions for the intersection points between systems?

For example, you mentioned men barely talk about sex with male friends. What if you designed a platform/system that addressed how we work AND how we relate simultaneously? Maybe something that helps distributed teams (which you know well) build deeper, more authentic connections that include discussing topics men typically avoid?

A few questions:

What would it look like to combine your technical platform-building skills with your insights about sexuality and relationships? Not necessarily sex education directly, but systems that enable better human connection?

And regarding your impostor feelings about psychology/sexology - what if your value isn't in being a certified therapist, but in being someone who can design systems and platforms that connect people with proper experts while creating safe spaces for exploration?

Finally, about transitioning from your NGO network - what if that network is actually an asset for understanding how mission-driven people work and what they need, even if you apply it in different domains?

What domain intersection excites you most when you think about it this way?

Surely I see myself as yet again founder, although I'm out of cash and I also know how many startups fail. Not sure how my back will survive another fall.... 
Great point about "identifying and designing solutions for the intersection points between systems". This reads almost like a Linkedin tagline!

What would it look like to combine your technical platform-building skills with your insights about sexuality and relationships?  - I have ideas for 2 apps, but both lack a business model. One would be a training app for guys to train their sensitivity/awareness/erotic fantasy without porn and toxic masculinity. The other is offline dating app where you do not swipe people, you just know who you can approach to say hi.

And regarding your impostor feelings about psychology/sexology - I agree, I could be a platform builder/ connector/ visionary and create a "system for mental help change", but leave the ground work to others. (unless my ideas turn out to be bullshit).

About mission driven people - I do not know how useful it is in business world, where people are profit-driven. They seem not to hold my ngo experience in high regard. Or maybe it's just I who do not hold it in high regard any more (maybe to my bad experiences with people).


Decoded founder's challenges, mapped potential mission-driven innovation paths.



Ha! I promise not to put "intersection point systems designer" on your LinkedIn 😄

But seriously, your app ideas are more interesting than you're giving them credit for. The offline dating concept especially - there's clearly market demand for alternatives to swipe-based dating, and you'd be solving a real coordination problem about how people actually meet and connect.

Let me ask some practical questions:

Financial reality check: Do you need to find employment first to rebuild financial stability, or do you have runway to explore founding again? Because there might be middle paths - consulting, fractional CTO work, or joining an early-stage company where you could have significant impact without carrying all the founder risk.

About your NGO experience being undervalued: I think you're wrong here. The business world is increasingly interested in people who understand mission-driven work, especially in areas like:

Companies building tools for social impact
B-Corps and purpose-driven businesses
ESG and sustainability tech
Employee engagement and meaningful work platforms
Your combination of technical leadership + understanding how mission-driven people actually work is valuable.

Regarding those app ideas: What if instead of thinking "no business model = dead end," you thought about them as ways to explore the problem space? You could start with workshops, communities, or even consulting to validate the problems before building platforms.

Here's my bigger question: What would success look like for you in 2-3 years? Not just professionally, but personally - what would make you feel like you're doing meaningful work that uses your talents well?

And are you open to paths that aren't "found another startup or get employed"?

Financial reality check - Yes, I would be open to this (consulting, fractional CTO work, or joining an early-stage company) but I do nothing on my radar at the moment... I have 4000EUR savings so not very much (I live in Warsaw, Poland).

Regarding those app ideas - Yes I want to run a "pilot" workshop where I develop the ideas and test how men react. I will invite from my social bubble (not a representative sample, i know). But lets' not go into planning out development ideas and keep to main topic, which is conceptualizing what is driving my work and what I am good at.

What would success look like for you in 2-3 years? - Ok so it looks like it. The app i have created (training for men they do themselves, but can consult an AI chatbot, which is powered by some expert knowledge from  books on sexuology. Aim is to have better connection with body, selling point is "become multiorgasmic", and a "byproduct" is actually better communicating, more sensitive men who are not porn-addicted and more aware of their fantasies, but now able to realize them with real women (and they enjoy it). The app is a success. I work with a network of sex-therapists who run workshops and 1:1 sessions under my brand. I select and hire young, smart people who want to do something new. I'm trying to go international.

And are you open to paths that aren't "found another startup or get employed"? - are there other paths???


Mapped strategic pathways for men's health tech venture




Wow, that vision is very clear and specific! You can see yourself as the platform builder who creates the infrastructure for experts to do their work, while you handle the technology, business development, and scaling. That's exactly the kind of "intersection point" role we talked about - you're not trying to be the therapist, but you're creating the system that enables better access to this kind of support.

Other paths to consider:

Building toward your vision incrementally:

Start with content creation (blog, newsletter) about men's sexual health while working part-time/consulting
Community building (Discord, workshops) to validate demand before building apps
Grants for social impact tech (there are EU programs for health/social innovation)
Adjacent opportunities that build relevant skills:

Health tech companies (mental health apps, wellness platforms)
Ed-tech companies focusing on adult learning/behavior change
Consulting for mission-driven startups in health/wellness space
Leveraging your existing network differently:

Your NGO contacts might know people in health tech, social innovation, or purpose-driven businesses
You could offer "technology for social impact" consulting to bridge that world
Given your 4000 EUR situation though, you probably need some income soon.

Practical question: What kind of part-time or contract work could you do in the next 3-6 months that would pay bills AND let you start exploring your men's health platform idea on the side?

Your Elixir/Phoenix skills are valuable - there are definitely remote opportunities there. Would you be open to taking contract work specifically to fund your exploration of this vision?

Yes, I am trying to do this, though Elixir/Phoenix contracting does not look hot right now. I'm also looking for normal job openings but they want only full-time! this would really exhaust me to do full time + work evenings on my startup. I'm 42, I see I cannot handle such intense work as I could when I was 30.


Strategized midlife career transition with pragmatic, energy-conscious approach.





That's such a real challenge - the "hustle culture" expectation that you can work full-time and build a startup on the side assumes you have the energy and life circumstances of a 25-year-old. At 42, you know your limits better, which is actually wisdom.

A few thoughts on navigating this:

Market reality: You're right that Elixir/Phoenix isn't as hot as it was. But your broader backend/infrastructure skills are valuable. Have you looked at:

Senior Python/Django roles (lots of overlap with your experience)
Platform engineering or SRE roles (your DevOps experience)
Technical advisor/consultant roles for smaller companies
Energy management: What if instead of "full-time job + evening startup work," you thought about roles where the day job actually develops skills you need for your vision? For example:

Health tech companies where you'd learn the regulatory/business side
Ed-tech companies focused on behavior change
Remote-first companies where you could negotiate 4-day weeks after proving yourself
Alternative funding: Have you looked into EU innovation grants? Poland has programs for social innovation, and men's mental health could qualify. It's not fast money, but it could buy you runway.

Realistic timeline question: What if your path to that 2-3 year vision takes 4-5 years instead, with the first 1-2 years being more about positioning and learning while maintaining financial stability?

Would a longer, more sustainable timeline feel like failure to you, or like wisdom?

I would not call it wisdom but I am a very persistent person, if i feel the goal is worth it.


Probed persistence, sustainability, and meaningful career path goals.


That's telling - you're persistent when the goal feels worth it. So the key question isn't really about timeline, it's about conviction.

Does this men's sexuality/mental health platform vision feel genuinely worth 4-5 years of your life? Not just intellectually interesting, but something that would sustain your energy through the inevitable frustrations and setbacks?

When you described your 2-3 year success scenario, there was real energy in your voice. But I'm curious - what specifically makes this feel different from digital campaigning? Because that also started with systemic change ambitions.

Is it:

The direct connection to something you've personally figured out (your own sexual development)?
The fact that it's building individual capacity rather than trying to change institutions?
Something else entirely?
And here's a practical question: If you took a full-time role now (even one that exhausts you), what would you need to see in your evening/weekend exploration of this idea to keep you motivated? What early signals would tell you "yes, this is worth the persistence"?

Because maybe the path forward isn't "find the perfect part-time gig" but "find any decent full-time gig and be very strategic about how you validate this vision in your limited free time."

What would make you confident enough in this direction to commit to that kind of grinding phase?

Why i think this is systemic:
* sexuality is very important on many levels
* yes it is connected to my experience (but this does not make it systemic)
* this topic also really shapes who men are, how they behave, and so on. so much masculine culture is related to this. This changing individual capacity (but at scale!) seems like big system change to me. I don't know. Maybe it's like Yoga with Adrienne - someone jokingly called her american public health system.

To keep me motivated - i think i would need to overcome self-deprecating impostor system, that this idea is some "tech-bro megalomaniac fantasy" you know? So I'd have to maybe see it works on real people..


Validated systemic change concept through critical personal reflection.





That's a brilliant analogy - "Yoga with Adrienne as the American public health system." Individual transformation tools that reach millions of people absolutely create systemic change. You're not wrong about that.

And your impostor syndrome concern is actually healthy skepticism, not self-sabotage. The fact that you're worried about tech-bro megalomania means you're not suffering from it. A true megalomaniac wouldn't even consider that possibility.

Here's what I notice: when you talk about digital campaigning, there's frustration and disillusionment. When you talk about this sexuality/men's development work, there's energy and specific vision. That difference matters.

The "works on real people" test is perfect. That's exactly how you validate whether this is meaningful or megalomaniac fantasy. And you have a way to test it - that pilot workshop you mentioned.

Practical thought: What if your full-time job search focused on companies where you'd be around the target demographic? Tech companies are full of men who might benefit from this kind of work. You could do informal conversations, gauge interest, maybe even recruit for your pilot workshop.

Or what about this angle: instead of "I'm building an app for men's sexuality," what if you started with "I'm researching how men's relationship to their sexuality affects their work performance, leadership, and team dynamics"? That frames it as organizational psychology research, which is more professionally acceptable while you explore the same territory.

Question: Does reframing it as "research into how this affects professional performance" feel like compromise or like a smart way to validate the core ideas?

Great idea about reframing.. are you sure it should be "affects professional performance" and not "wellbeing" or "life satisfaction"? or should it be more business oriented?


Weighed framing options to balance professional and personal goals.





Good catch - you're right to question that framing. "Professional performance" might be too narrow and honestly a bit reductive of what you actually care about.

"Wellbeing" probably hits the sweet spot because:

It's broad enough to include the full systemic change you envision
Companies are increasingly investing in employee wellbeing programs
It's professionally credible without being corporate-speak
It allows you to explore the real connections between sexuality, mental health, relationships, and overall life satisfaction
"Life satisfaction" is even more honest to your actual vision, but might be harder to get institutional buy-in for research.

Or what about "men's emotional and relational development"? That captures the sexuality piece without being explicit, includes the communication/relationship benefits you mentioned, and positions it as personal development rather than just wellness.

The key is picking language that:

Opens doors for you professionally
Doesn't make you feel like you're lying about what you really care about
Attracts the right kind of collaborators and research subjects
Which of these feels most authentic to what you actually want to explore while still being something you could talk about in professional settings?

You know yourself - what framing would make you feel energized to have those conversations rather than like you're putting on a corporate mask?

this is good: "I'm researching how men's relationship to their sexuality affects men's emotional and relational development"


Validated research framing and strategized potential next steps.



Perfect! That framing is honest, professionally credible, and opens interesting conversations. You're not hiding the sexuality component, but you're contextualizing it within broader human development. That's exactly the kind of systems thinking you're good at.

And notice what just happened - you took my suggestion and made it better. You instinctively knew "professional performance" was too narrow for what you actually care about. That's your vision working.

Now you have a research angle that:

You can mention in job interviews (shows you're thinking beyond just coding)
Could be relevant to HR teams, wellness programs, or diversity initiatives
Gives you legitimate reasons to have conversations with men in various contexts
Positions you as someone exploring an underresearched area
Practical next steps:

You could start those conversations now, even while job hunting
When networking or in interviews, you could mention this research interest
Your pilot workshop becomes "research" rather than just testing a business idea
Question: Does this framing make you more excited about taking even a full-time job? Because now your day job becomes your research environment and participant recruitment pool, not just the thing that pays bills while you work on something else entirely.

How does it feel to have language that bridges your authentic interests with professional credibility?

About this I am not so sure.. It will be a bit wierd to go around office and ask men about their sex life you know? But lets stop now about this connection between full time job and my research.
Could you go back to when you said I can work to build platforms that work on intersectional issues, and summarize this as a sort of "persona" that I am? (or my drive type?).


Architected systemic platform for enabling expert-driven social change.
11s





Absolutely - you're right that office conversations about sexuality would be weird! Let me step back and synthesize what I'm seeing about your core drive.

Your persona/drive type seems to be: "Systemic Infrastructure Builder"

You identify complex, underexplored problems where systems intersect (politics + technology, masculinity + mental health, coordination + organizational behavior), then you build the technical and social infrastructure that enables domain experts to address these problems at scale.

You're not trying to be the therapist or the political scientist or the organizational psychologist - you're the architect who creates platforms, frameworks, and systems that let those experts reach more people and work more effectively.

This pattern shows up repeatedly:

Built campaigning platforms that let activists coordinate better
Want to build platforms that connect men with sexuality/wellness experts
Interested in coordination theory - the infrastructure of how people work together
Drew to "serving brilliant people with good tech"
You get energized by:

Pattern recognition - seeing the deep structures others miss
Systems design - architecting solutions for complex intersection problems
Enabling multiplication - building infrastructure that amplifies experts' impact
Your sweet spot seems to be finding systemic gaps that are technically complex but socially important, then building the bridges between domains that allow real change to happen.

Does that capture something essential about what drives you?

I think so!


Pondered next steps for user's systemic infrastructure insight.



Great! That feels like an important insight to land on.

So now you have language for what drives you: you're someone who builds infrastructure at the intersection of complex systems to enable domain experts to create change at scale.

This gives you a lens for evaluating opportunities:

Does this role let me identify systemic gaps?
Am I building infrastructure that multiplies others' impact?
Are there interesting intersections between domains here?
Will I be working with people whose expertise I want to amplify?
And it explains your frustrations:

Digital campaigning became too surface-level, not systemic enough
Working with people who didn't want to learn or use tools thoughtfully
Organizations that weren't actually creating the deep change they claimed
This persona could apply to many domains - health tech, education, organizational development, climate solutions, cooperative economics. The key is finding the right intersection that energizes you.

One final question: Now that you have this clearer sense of your drive, what feels like the most important next step? Is it:

Finding work that aligns with this persona while you develop your men's development research?
Getting clearer on which intersection excites you most?
Something else entirely?
How do you want to use this insight about what drives you?

Finding work that aligns with this persona while you develop your men's development research- this is one i want to do now.


Mapped potential career paths aligning with systemic infrastructure persona.





Perfect! That's a concrete, actionable direction.

Let's think about what "aligns with this persona" looks like in practice:

Types of companies/roles to target:

Health tech companies building platforms that connect patients with experts
Ed-tech companies focused on professional development or behavior change
B-Corps or social enterprises using technology for systemic impact
Early-stage startups in mental health, organizational development, or future-of-work
Platform companies that serve professionals (like how you'd want to serve sexuality experts)
Companies building infrastructure for distributed teams/remote collaboration
How to position yourself: Instead of "I'm an NGO developer," try "I build technical infrastructure that helps domain experts scale their impact." Your campaigning platforms become case studies in enabling coordination at scale.

Practical search strategy:

Look for "Senior Backend Engineer" or "Platform Engineer" roles at mission-driven companies
Search job boards like AngelList, Wellfound for startups with social impact missions
LinkedIn searches for companies working on "systems change," "behavioral health," "organizational development"
EU-based remote companies (your timezone + your language skills)
Quick question: Would you be open to remote work for companies outside Poland? That would significantly expand your options for finding the right intersection.

What feels like the most realistic first step - updating your positioning, expanding your search geography, or something else?

yes, I want remote work in EU (it's better money!) 
Lets update my resume now! I think keeping similar structure (about - can be a shorter version for PDF and longer for LinkedIn), skills, experience (lets change what I highlight in there).


Crafted strategic resume blueprint for EU remote impact roles.




Excellent! Let's reframe your resume to highlight the "Systemic Infrastructure Builder" persona while keeping your technical credibility strong.

Updated Resume - Systemic Infrastructure Builder
Document 
I've reframed your resume to emphasize your "Systemic Infrastructure Builder" persona. Key changes:

What I highlighted differently:

Systems thinking and pattern recognition - your ability to see intersections others miss
Infrastructure and platform building - rather than just "development"
Enabling domain experts to scale - your role in multiplying others' impact
Remote leadership experience - crucial for EU companies
Technical depth in backend/infrastructure - your core strength
Language shifts:

"Architected platforms that enabled..." instead of just "built apps"
"Scaling impact for domain experts" instead of just "working with users"
"Systems design that bridges domains" instead of generic full-stack work
Added your research interest in organizational development/coordination systems
For job applications:

Use the shorter About for PDFs
Use the longer LinkedIn version for online profiles
The experience bullets now tell a story of infrastructure building and systems thinking
This positions you as someone who can architect solutions for complex problems at mission-driven companies - exactly what you want to attract.

Ready to start targeting those EU remote roles in health tech, ed-tech, and social impact companies?
